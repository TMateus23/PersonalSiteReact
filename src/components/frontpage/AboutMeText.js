                    Hey! I'm Tomas Mateus, a graduate in Computer Engineering Bachelor's degree from the University of Évora, currently living in Santarém, Portugal. <br />
                    I'm passionate about web development and aim to become a full-stack developer, with a strong focus on front-end design and user experience. <br />
                    I'm naturally curious and always looking for new things to learn, whether it's the latest tech trends or solving problems in creative ways. <br />
                    I am currently in the first year of my Master's degree in Informatics and Management at ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, studying in a part-time, post-work program. <br />
                    Outside of code, I'm a big fan of football, love to travel, and enjoy spending time gaming. <br />
                    This site is a glimpse into what I do, what I'm learning, and where I'm heading. Feel free to look around!
